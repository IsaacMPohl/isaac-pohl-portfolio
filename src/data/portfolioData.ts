    aboutIntro: "My main motivation is to help advance agriculture through technology. I care about understanding the grower, agronomist, researcher, or other person who will use a tool, then making information easier to work with. My agriculture and computer science classes, fieldwork, software internships, greenhouse experience, and service work contribute different parts of that perspective.",
    aboutAgService: "At Pohl Ag Service, I have collected soil and leaf samples and built a Microsoft Access database that connects leaf-sample results to fields and trials. Working with an agronomist on the comparison graphs helped me see how useful software starts with understanding the questions someone needs to answer.",
    aboutGreenhouse: "Running Pohl's Greenhouse gave me another perspective on that connection. I managed plants, customers, records, and equipment, and used lighting and watering technology to support the operation. At Murray State, I am building on those experiences through computer science and agriculture coursework, with a growing interest in AI, data analysis, and precision agriculture.",

      title: 'Winter 2026 Marathon Training — St. Jude Memphis Marathon (December 5, 2026)',
      season: 'Winter 2026 Marathon',
      location: 'Memphis, Tennessee',
      date: 'December 5, 2026',
      status: 'Current Training Goal (Not a completed race)',
      postText: `Hey everyone, I’m training to run the St. Jude Marathon in Memphis on December 5. I want those 26.2 miles to challenge me and give me a way to be part of something bigger than myself.

“Don’t tell me the sky is the limit when there are footprints on the moon.”

That quote in St. Jude patient Kane’s artwork makes me think about the limits we put on ourselves. I have goals for this race, and I may not reach every one, but I don’t want to decide what I’m capable of before giving myself a chance to try. I want to approach more of life that way, and I hope this encourages someone else to do the same.

Those footprints also took a lot of people working toward something they believed was possible. Helen Keller’s words, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much,” fit that idea. We each have something to contribute, and encouraging each other can help us take on things we might otherwise keep putting off.

I’m putting together a team, and I’d really love to have some of you join me. St. Jude offers a virtual 5K, so you can walk or run 3.1 miles in your neighborhood, at a park, or wherever works for you during the virtual race window. Maybe my part is 26.2 miles and yours is 3.1, but we’re supporting the same cause and giving each other something to work toward.

If you’re interested in joining the team, just message me! Once it’s set up, I’ll send you my team’s signup link and instructions and help you get registered.

Kahlil Gibran wrote, “It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.” With so much competing for our attention today, I think choosing to spend some of our time helping others matters. You don’t have to donate to make a difference. Training for this race, taking time to walk or run, and sharing why we’re participating are ways to raise awareness for St. Jude. Inviting a friend or encouraging someone along the way can help that effort reach further.

That brings me back to those footprints on the moon and the people who gave their time to make something bigger possible. I’d love for us to bring that same willingness to this, each doing our part and seeing what we can accomplish together.

Thank you,
Isaac Pohl`,
